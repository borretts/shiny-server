## Shiny Project ##
## All shiny apps use this template ##
##  1) It initializes an empty UI and an empty server, and runs an app using 
##    these empty parts. 
##  2) Copy this template into a new file named app.R in a new folder. 
##  3) It is very important that the name of the file is app.R, 
##    otherwise it would not be recognized as a Shiny app. 
##  4) It is also very important that you place this app in its own folder, and 
##  not in a folder that already has other R scripts or files, unless those other 
##  files are used by your app.

## After saving the file, RStudio should recognize that this is a Shiny app, and
## you should see the usual Run button at the top change to Run App.
